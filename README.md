The Arduio Sketch Example titled 'OLED_Moving_Eyes_3_Arrays' already has three C File Arrays in the sketch.
You will be able to run this sketch on an Arduino UNO or MEGA.

The Arduio Sketch Example titled 'OLED_Moving_Eyes_Defalut' allows you to enter the C File Arrays you create.

You will need to use an 'Image to C Array Converter' to create C File Arrays for 128x64 OLED.

As a BONUS, added a Sketch just for Arduino MEGA that is too large to use on an Arduino UNO.

Also added an example moving GIF that shows what you will see on your 128x64 OLED Display.

Added Example Sketch for ARDUINO LOGO Splash Screen that will last 5 seconds on OLED Display.
